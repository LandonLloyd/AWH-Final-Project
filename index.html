      <p class="paragraph">Genghis Khan was a great military leader. He was able to grow his empire to become the biggest contiguous empire that the world has ever seen. Genghis was a great military leader. Although ruthless at times, revolutionary nonetheless. From creating biological warfare to making trade safe on Earth for the first time in history, Genghis Khan was a very powerful man.</p>

      <h1 class="title">Weapons</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">The weapon of choice for the Mongol army was the composite bow. From the time boys and girls were little children they were trained in physical activity related to the military. The composite bow allowed members of the military to shoot from over twice the distance of other competing militaries. It is said that the composite bow could shoot accurately from 700-800 meters away from its target.The composite bow was made from multiple layers of wood, bamboo or horn. This gave the bow a ncie flexibility. Some other weapons that the Mongols used were battle axes, lances, spears, daggers, long knives, and sometimes swords.</p>

      <h1 class="title">Horses</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">The Mongol horse is the secret to their success. Genghis and his army were able to travel 60-75 miles every single day. This type of transportation was unheard of in this time. Without the horses many of Genghis's tactics wouldn't have worked. With horses Genghis was able to pull of many maneuvers that allowed him to take over many areas and people. Mongol riders could live on horseback for multiple days. This was because of the design of the saddle that the Mongols used. All Mongol soldiers were given more than one horse and so they could switch out horses so that the horses would never be exhausted. The horses were small but sturdy beasts and without them the Mongol empire would never have become the massive empire we know it as today.</p>
